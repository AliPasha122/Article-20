Ice accumulation on sidewalks, driveways, and outdoor stairs causes accidents and injuries
every winter. Existing solutions like salt deicers and heated mats are energy-intensive,
corrosive, or environmentally harmful. This research proposes a novel self-healing, icerepellent coating that uses a hybrid of nano-structured hydrophobic materials with
embedded phase-change salts to passively prevent ice formation while maintaining surface
integrity.
